# Fire_Detection
This is my submission for my internship of AICTE on the project topic "FIRE DETECTION/DEFORESTATION DETECTION".
This project involves analyzing MODIS satellite fire data for the years 2021â€“2023.
The goal is to explore the dataset, clean it, and perform basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand fire detection patterns in India.

Included:

Jupyter Notebook with structured steps

Datasets (.csv files) used for analysis

Visualizations and markdowns for clear understanding
