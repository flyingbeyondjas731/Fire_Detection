# Fire_Detection
This is my submission for my internship of AICTE on the project topic "FIRE DETECTION/DEFORESTATION DETECTION".
This project involves analyzing MODIS satellite fire data for the years 2021â€“2023.
The goal is to explore the dataset, clean it, and perform basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand fire detection patterns in India.

Included:

Jupyter Notebook with structured steps

Datasets (.csv files) used for analysis

Visualizations and markdowns for clear understanding
I am adding the link in the readme file since my Model - best_fire_detection_model.pkl file is 460.1 MB. Any file larger than 25 MB is not accepted in the Github without LFS. Students, you can also share the link in the github just like I did. If you don't know how to create the readme file, you can download my readme file and edit it.
